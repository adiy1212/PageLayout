				<p>one of the toughest things for people to
				do is to anticipate sudden change. Typically
				we project the future by extrapolating
				from trends in the past. Much of the time
				this approach works well. But sometimes it fails
				spectacularly, and people are simply blindsided
				by events such as today’s economic crisis.
								For most of us, the idea that civilization itself
				could disintegrate probably seems preposterous.
				Who would not find it hard to think seriously
				about such a complete departure from what we
				expect of ordinary life? What evidence could
				make us heed a warning so dire—and how would
				we go about responding to it? We are so inured
				to a long list of highly unlikely catastrophes that
				we are virtually programmed to dismiss them all
				with a wave of the hand: Sure, our civilization
				might devolve into chaos—and Earth might collide
				with an asteroid, too!
				For many years I have studied global agricultural,
				population, environmental and economic
				trends and their interactions. The combined effects
				of those trends and the political tensions
				they generate point to the breakdown of governments
				and societies. Yet I, too, have resisted the
				idea that food shortages could bring down not
				only individual governments but also our global
				civilization.
				I can no longer ignore that risk. Our continuing
				failure to deal with the environmental declines
				that are undermining the world food economy—
				most important, falling water tables,
				eroding soils and rising temperatures—forces me
				to conclude that such a collapse is possible.

				<p>Even a cursory look at the vital signs of our current
				world order lends unwelcome support to my
				conclusion. And those of us in the environmental
				field are well into our third decade
				of charting
				trends of environmental decline without seeing
				any significant effort to reverse a single one.
				In six of the past nine years world grain production
				has fallen short of consumption, forcing
				a steady drawdown in stocks. When the 2008
				harvest began, world carryover stocks of grain
				(the amount in the bin when the new harvest begins)
				were at 62 days of consumption, a near reenvironment cord low. In response, world grain prices in the
				spring and summer of last year climbed to the
				highest level ever.
				As demand for food rises faster than supplies
				are growing, the resulting food-price inflation
				puts severe stress on the governments of countries
				already teetering on the edge of chaos. Unable
				to buy grain or grow their own, hungry people
				take to the streets. Indeed, even before the
				steep climb in grain prices in 2008, the number
				of failing states was expanding [see sidebar at
				left]. Many of their problems stem from a failure
				to slow the growth of their populations. But if
				the food situation continues to deteriorate, entire
				nations will break down at an ever increasing
					rate. We have entered a new era in geopolitics.
				In the 20th century the main threat to international
				security was superpower conflict; today
				it is failing states. It is not the concentration of
				power but its absence that puts us at risk.
				States fail when national governments can no
				longer provide personal security, food security
				and basic social services such as education and
				health care. They often lose control of part or all
				of their territory. When governments lose their
				monopoly on power, law and order begin to disintegrate.
				After a point, countries can become so
				dangerous that food relief workers are no longer
					safe and their programs are halted; in Somalia
				and Afghanistan, deteriorating conditions have
				already put such programs in jeopardy.
					Failing states are of international concern because
				they are a source of terrorists, drugs, weapons
				and refugees, threatening political stability everywhere. Somalia, number one on the 2008
				list of failing states, has become a base for piracy.
				Iraq, number five, is a hotbed for terrorist training.
				Afghanistan, number seven, is the world’s
				leading supplier of heroin. Following the massive
				genocide of 1994 in Rwanda, refugees from that
				troubled state, thousands of armed soldiers among
					them, helped to destabilize neighboring Democratic
				Republic of the Congo (number six).
				Our global civilization depends on a functioning
				network of politically healthy nationstates
				to control the spread of infectious disease,
				to manage the international monetary system,
				to control international terrorism and to reach
				scores of other common goals. If the system for
				controlling infectious diseases—such as polio,
					SARS or avian flu—breaks down, humanity will
				be in trouble. Once states fail, no one assumes
				responsibility for their debt to outside lenders. If
				enough states disintegrate, their fall will threaten
				the stability of global civilization itself.

				<h2 id="thirdheadline">A New Kind of Food Shortage</h2>
			
				<p>The surge in world grain prices in 2007 and
				2008—and the threat they pose to food security—
				has a different, more troubling quality than
				the increases of the past. During the second half
				of the 20th century, grain prices rose dramatically
				several times. In 1972, for instance, the Soviets,
				recognizing their poor harvest early, quietly
				cornered the world wheat market. As a result,
				wheat prices elsewhere more than doubled, pulling
				rice and corn prices up with them. But this
				and other price shocks were event-driven—underdrought
				in the Soviet Union, a monsoon failure
				in India, crop-shrinking heat in the U.S. Corn
				Belt. And the rises were short-lived: prices typically
				returned to normal with the next harvest.
				In contrast, the recent surge in world grain
				prices is trend-driven, making it unlikely to reverse
				without a reversal in the trends themselves.
				On the demand side, those trends include the ongoing
				addition of more than 70 million people a
				year; a growing number of people wanting to
				move up the food chain to consume highly grainintensive
				livestock products [see “The Greenhouse
				Hamburger,” by Nathan Fiala; Scientific
				American, February 2009]; and the massive diversion
				of U.S. grain to ethanol-fuel distilleries.
				The extra demand for grain associated with
				rising affluence varies widely among countries.
				People in low-income countries where grain
				supplies 60 percent of calories, such as India,
				directly consume a bit more than a pound of
				grain a day. In affluent countries such as the
				U.S. and Canada, grain consumption per person
				is nearly four times that much, though perhaps
				90 percent of it is consumed indirectly as
				meat, milk and eggs from grain-fed animals.
				The potential for further grain consumption
				as incomes rise among low-income consumers
				is huge. But that potential pales beside the insatiable
				demand for crop-based automotive fuels.
				A fourth of this year’s U.S. grain harvest—
				enough to feed 125 million Americans or half a
				billion Indians at current consumption levels—
				will go to fuel cars. Yet even if the entire U.S.
				grain harvest were diverted into making ethanol,
				it would meet at most 18 percent of U.S.
				automotive fuel needs. The grain required to
				fill a 25-gallon SUV tank with ethanol could
				feed one person for a year.
				The recent merging of the food and energy
				economies implies that if the food value of grain
				is less than its fuel value, the market will move
				the grain into the energy economy. That double
				demand is leading to an epic competition between
				cars and people for the grain supply and
				to a political and moral issue of unprecedented
				dimensions. The U.S., in a misguided effort to
				reduce its dependence on foreign oil by substituting
				grain-based fuels, is generating global food
				insecurity on a scale not seen before.

				<p>Our challenge is not only to implement Plan B
				but also to do it quickly. The world is in a race
				between political tipping points and natural
				ones. Can we close coal-fired power plants fast
				enough to prevent the Greenland ice sheet from
				slipping into the sea and inundating our coastlines?
				Can we cut carbon emissions fast enough
				to save the mountain glaciers of Asia? During
				the dry season their meltwaters sustain the major
				rivers of India and China—and by extension,
				hundreds of millions of people. Can we stabilize
				population before countries such as India, Pakistan
				and Yemen are overwhelmed by shortages
				of the water they need to irrigate their crops?
				It is hard to overstate the urgency of our predicament.
				Every day counts. Unfortunately, we
				do not know how long we can light our cities
				with coal, for instance, before Greenland’s ice
				sheet can no longer be saved. Nature sets the
				deadlines; nature is the timekeeper. But we human
				beings cannot see the clock.
				We desperately need a new way of thinking,
				a new mind-set. The thinking that got us into
				this bind will not get us out. When Elizabeth
				Kolbert, a writer for the New Yorker, asked energy
				guru Amory Lovins about thinking outside
				the box, Lovins responded: “There is no box.”
				There is no box. That is the mind-set we need
				if civilization is to survive.
