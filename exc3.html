			The need for innovative and effective solutions for environmental 
			problems led us to investigate the efficiency of water toxicity monitoring using Whole-cell Biosensors.
In times where size, portability and price are an integral part of technological devices requirements in every field,
 chemical techniques for water toxicity monitoring no longer provide the best solution in that area. In the last few years
  a lot of biological methods were discovered and tested as an 
  alternative for the chemical methods in the environmental field. 
  In this research we created a new whole-cell water pollution

  monitoring. The main renewal in our biosensor is the immobilization of the 
  bioreporters (E. coli TV1061 bacteria) in small pads (with calcium-alginate matrix) using different kind of optic detection systems such as Liquid Light Guide (LLG) and CCD-Camera. The main goal of this proof-on-concept research was to optimize the system (Alginate concentration and bacteria concentration) and to test it with different kinds of analytes (heavy metal, EDC's and organic solvents).
This research is an important milestone in exploring different ways to make the Biosensor system more portable, ef
fective and accessible
